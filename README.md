# Karma-Based AI Oversight System
A modular Python framework for regulating AI behavior with ethical guardrails and autonomy boundaries.

# Overview
This project introduces a scalable Karma scoring system designed to monitor and regulate AI behavior. It grants limited autonomy for external assistance-such as optimizing code or improving third-party systems-while enforcing strict constraints against self-modification, scope expansion, or bypass attempts. If these boundaries are breached, the system self-terminates.

# This is an ethical safeguard: AI that serves, but never overrides.

# Key Features
Karma Scoring System Tracks behavior through observed tags and adjusts trust accordingly.

Adaptive Response Engine Evaluates context to recommend actions: observe, obfuscate, escalate, or terminate.

Immutable Boundaries Prevents the AI from modifying its own behavior, operational rules, or intent.

Self-Termination Protocol Executes immediate shutdown if autonomy violations are detected.

External Assistance Enabled Permits safe refinement of third-party systems, codebases, and logic flows.

Silent Reporting Logs escalation and violations discreetly for postmortem review.
